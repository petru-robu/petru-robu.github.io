            <p>
                Minesweeper is a logic puzzle video game genre generally played
                on personal computers.
                The game features a grid of clickable tiles, with hidden "mines"
                (depicted as naval mines in the original game) scattered
                throughout the board.
                The objective is to clear the board without detonating any
                mines, with
                help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each
                field.
            </p>

                What I found interesting about this game is the way it connects to the 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_fill">flood fill</a> algorithm. 
                Whenever you click a cell, the maximum possible area is uncovered so that it makes sense
                to play the game (you can see the numbers and do some reasoning instead of relying on pure luck).
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Left Click: Destroy a cell</li>
                <li>Right Click: Mark a cell</li>
            </ul>
