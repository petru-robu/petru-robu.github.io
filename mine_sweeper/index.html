      <h1>Minesweeper</h1>
      <p>
        Minesweeper is a logic puzzle video game genre generally played on
        personal computers. The game features a grid of clickable tiles, with
        hidden "mines" (depicted as naval mines in the original game) scattered
        throughout the board. The objective is to clear the board without
        detonating any mines, with help from clues about the number of
        neighboring mines in each field.

        What I found interesting about this game is the way it connects to the
        <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_fill"
          >flood fill</a
        >
        algorithm. Whenever you click a cell, the maximum possible area is
        uncovered so that it makes sense to play the game (you can see the
        numbers and do some reasoning instead of relying on pure luck).
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Left Click: Destroy a cell</li>
        <li>Right Click: Mark a cell</li>
      </ul>
