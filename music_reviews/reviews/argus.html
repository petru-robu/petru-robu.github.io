        <h3>Review</h3>
        <p>
            Albumul este, dupa pararea mea, unul dintre cele mai interesante albume de rock progresiv din toate timpurile. Compozitia, aranjamentele sunt foarte bune si
            depasesc tiparele standard de rock si de blues. Wishbone Ash mai au si alte albume, dar care nu inoveaza la fel de mult si sunt bazate mult pe blues si rock. 
            Argus aduce elemente noi si un sunet progresiv foarte bun. Versurile sunt, de asemenea, foarte interesante, asa cum numai un album de progresiv din anii 
            70' poate fi. Tematica albumului este medievala, dar unele melodii sunt de sine statatoare, fara a avea legatura cu acest concept.

            Steve Harris de la Iron Maiden spune:
             "I think if anyone wants to understand Maiden's early thing, in particular the harmony guitars, all they have to do is listen to Wishbone Ash's Argus album."

        <h3>Topul pieselor</h3>
        <p>
            Pentru mine, top 3 piese din album sunt urmatoarele:
            <ul>
                <li>Time Was - pentru acustice, mix bun</li>
                <li>Sometime World - pentru muzica, versuri</li>
                <li>Leaf and Stream - pentru chitari, sunet western</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Versuri Warrior</h3>
        <p>
            I'm leaving to search for something new<br>
            Leaving everything I ever knew<br>
            A hundred years in the sunshine<br>
            Hasn't taught me all there is to know<br><br>

            The valley, we will gather there<br>
            Helpless in our surrender<br>
            Tomorrow the plow becomes the sword<br>
            Make us stronger in our danger<br><br>

            Time will pass away<br>
            Time will guard our secret<br>
            I'll return again<br>
            To fight another day<br><br>

            I'd have to be a warrior<br>
            A slave I couldn't be<br>
            A soldier and a conqueror<br>
            Fighting to be free<br>
            (Repeat three times)<br>
        </p>

        <h3>Versuri Blowin' Free</h3>
        <p>
            I thought I had a girl<br>
            And all because I seen her<br>
            Her hair was golden brown<br>
            Blowin' free like a cornfield<br><br>
            She was far away<br>
            I found it hard to reach her<br>
            She told me you can try<br>
            But it's impossible to find her<br><br>
            In my dreams everything was all right<br>
            In your schemes you can only try<br><br>
            I thought I had a girl<br>
            And all because I seen her<br>
            Her hair was golden brown, (yeah)<br>
            Blowin' free like a cornfield<br>
        </p>    
        
        <h3>Versuri Sometime World</h3>

        <p>
            I met a man who felt the same way,<br>
            That the world had passed him by.<br>
            Told to me all his troubles,<br>
            That the world had made him cry.<br>
            Life had kept him waiting,<br>
            Regretting his pain inside.<br>
            Had to feel underrated,<br>
            And hated, besides.<br>
            Life had kept him waiting,<br>
            Regretting his shame inside.<br>
            Had to feel underrated,<br>
            And hated, besides.<br>
            Sometime world, pass me by again,<br>
            Carry you, carry me, away.<br>
            (Repeat twice)
        </p>
