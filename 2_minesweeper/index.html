    <h1>Minesweeper</h1>
    <p>
        Minesweeper is a logic puzzle video game genre generally played on personal computers. 
        The game features a grid of clickable tiles, with hidden "mines" 
        (depicted as naval mines in the original game) scattered throughout the board. 
        The objective is to clear the board without detonating any mines, with 
        help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field.<br>
        A game of Minesweeper begins when the player first selects a cell on a board. 
        In some variants the first click is guaranteed to be safe, and some further guarantee 
        that all adjacent cells are safe as well. During the game, the player uses 
        information given from the opened cells to deduce further cells that are safe to open, 
        iteratively gaining more information to solve the board. The player is also given the number 
        of remaining mines in the board, known as the minecount, which is calculated as the total number 
        of mines subtracted by the number of flagged cells.
